## Coding standards

- Every generated function and test should have a comment before it briefly describing what it's doing and its purpose or the reason for using it
- Variable names should use snake_case
- Tests should avoid advanced features like custom case classes and parameterization whenever it's reasonable to do so. Use them only when it's necessary, or avoiding them would produce unnecessarily complex code.
