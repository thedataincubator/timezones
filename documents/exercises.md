### User story
As a meeting planner, I want the results to appear as a grid on the same page as the inputs, so that I can iterate without losing context.

Out of scope:
- Navigating to a separate results page
- Downloading or sharing results

Acceptance criteria:
- After conversion, results render on the same page without requiring navigation to a different page
- The grid layout is row-based for proposed times and column-based for target zones/cities
- The grid includes a header row for target zones/cities and a first column (or equivalent) for the base time entries
- Results are visible and inputs remain available on the same page
- Altering a time or timezone and converting results in a correctly updated grid
