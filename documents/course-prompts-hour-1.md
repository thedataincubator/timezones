## Prompting Strategies

### Starting Point

I need to make some entries for a company directory.

### Structure and Clarity

Generate  some fake entries for a company directory that we can use for testing.  For each entry include : first name, last name, email, phone, number, pay level, and hire date.

### Specificity and Information

Generate 15 fake entries for a company directory that we can use for testing. For each entry include : first name, last name, email, phone, number, pay level, and hire date.​

​Format each entry as follows:​

{'first_name': 'John', 'last_name': 'Smith', 'email': 'jsmith@fakeco.fake', 'phone-number': 'x324', 'pay_level': '12-B', 'hire_date': '20210612'}
